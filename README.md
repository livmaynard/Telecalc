This program will calculate telescope and eyepiece combinations. Lists
of different eyepieces can be compared on different telescopes. The
results can be printed to show magnification and actual field of view
for each combination

Input: There are 2 separate input files required. "tele_input.txt" for
telescope input. Multiple telescopes are are allowed. Each telescope has a
name, aperture (in), and length (mm). "eye_input.txt" allows for multiple
eyepieces each with a name, apparent field of view, and focal length (mm).
